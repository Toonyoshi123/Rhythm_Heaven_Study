# Rhythm_Heaven_Study
In this project, I tried to uncover the secrets behind Rhythm Heaven for the DS. 
Most of these secrets tailor to the rhythm aspect of input and hit detection, which are mostly invisible to the player.
It is very noticable that a Guitar Hero-clone is much easier to make, with the use of colliders and triggers. 
But it is not that easy in Rhythm Heaven...

A few points that crossed my mind, which I am researching as I go:
1. Is it possible to use (animation)curves as detection data, instead of a note class kept in a list? And is it better?
2. What works better: detection check per beat (higher than the original bpm) or detection check on specific times?

Feel free to use this project as a basis for your own rhythm games, but please do refer to this project when you do!
